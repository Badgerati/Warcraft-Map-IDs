Warcraft Map IDs
================

Here is a list of nearly every possible Map ID for use with add-on development for World of Warcraft.
The IDs are already formatted for use with LUA, and can be freely used by everyone.

The IDs were obtained initially from WoWWiki, but also from an add-on I once created called QuestTracker - so a lot of
them have been collected purely by myself. You will find the IDs for all the expansions - including Cataclysm. Even
including the Map IDs for the Outland dungeons from an update Blizzard made later on.

As pointed out above, this is nearly all of the IDs. So if you do come across one not listed here, please tell me :)
